This is a tutorial on how to setup the chatbot system for your Discord server.

!!!info
We'll assume you've already invited PainBot to your server, but if you haven't check out [this page](/introduction/invite.md).
!!!

## Enabling chatbot

Type `/chatbot enable` into the chat, then press enter. You should now see this:

Choose your chatbot channel by clicking it on the list or typing it's name, then send the command by pressing enter.

You should now see this message:

![](/assets/screenshots/chatbot_enable2.png)

Now go to your chatbot channel and have a conversation with PainBot!

## Disabling chatbot

Type `/chatbot disable` into the chat, then send the command by pressing enter twice.

You should now see this message:

![](/assets/screenshots/chatbot_disable.png)

This indicates that the chatbot has been disabled.

## Viewing the chatbot settings

To view the current chatbot settings, type `/chatbot settings`, then send the command by pressing enter twice.

You should see a message like this:

![](/assets/screenshots/chatbot_settings.png)

This just means that the chatbot has been setup on the `#chatbot` channel.

But if you see a message like this:

![](/assets/screenshots/chatbot_settings_nochannel.png)

That means you haven't set up the chatbot. Go back to the [enabling chatbot section](#enabling-chatbot) to know how to setup chatbot.
