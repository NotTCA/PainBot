# What is PainBot?

PainBot is a multipurpose Discord bot with fun in mind.

## What can PainBot do?

I'm glad you asked! Here's a list of **some** of the features PainBot has to offer:

- **Moderation** - Is someone spamming L + ratio in your chat? Not anymore!
- **Games** - Ever feeling bored? Just play some snake, find some words in a jumbled mess of letters, or even try to type a word as quickly as you can. And plus, more games are being added on a regular basis!
- **Chatbot** - Still feeling bored? You can have a conversation with PainBot! Talk about your depression, ask a math question, the possibilities are (nearly) endless!
- **And more coming soon!**
