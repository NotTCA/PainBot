# PainBot v2

This repo tries to rewrite my public bot, [PainBot](https://github.com/TCACodes/PainBot) in [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) v13.

# FAQ

### Will PainBot have slash (/) commands?

We don't currently have any plans for moving any commands to slash commands.

### I experienced a bug, where can I report it?

We plan on making a Discord support server for PainBot, but currently that is still a work in progress, so for now you can make an issue on this repo or [on the v1 repo](https://github.com/TCACodes/PainBot), depending on what version you're using.

### Are you planning on getting PainBot verified on Discord?

No. At least not right now.

### Why are you rewriting PainBot?

Because I started this project when I first began to code, and now I've gotten better at coding so I want to try and recode PainBot from scratch using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) v13.
